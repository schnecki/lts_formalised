\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Introduce abbreviations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lead Time Syndrome (\LTS{})
\item Work-in-process (\WIP{})
\end{itemize}


Related literature \MS[t]{Cite!} argues that the lead time syndrome can only occur (i) if a lead
time is set dynamically and nonreciprocal according to the current \WIP{}-level and (ii) the order
releases monotonically depend on this lead time. In a practical point of view this assumption is
correct, however theoretically the interconnection between \WIP{}-level and number of releases is
not needed to infer this systematic releasing misbehavior.

\begin{proof}{Proof}
  Consider a manufacturer with constant demand and an order release mechanism which strictly
  increases the number of orders to be released on every release decision, e.g.~by 1 order. Clearly
  the release decision does neither depend on the flow time nor lead time. However, considered over
  time this leads to a monotonically increasing \WIP{}-level which again leads to a monotonically
  increasing lead time.\qed
\end{proof}

% \MS{name clash: LEAD TIME Syndrome with no LEAD TIME?}
Despite this theoretical observation the name lead time syndrome may be under question. However, as
in cases like the one given in the proof above the lead time follows the order release decisions and
in practice order releases are usually determined by the lead time (or flow time), the wording can
be considered as appropriate.
%
Nonetheless, our method is based on this observation. First we do not consider the lead time as
input variable to the method, then we do not suppose an interconnection between the \WIP{}-level
with the release decision procedure, and finally we do not restrict our method on any particular
order release pattern.


\section{The Lead Time Syndrome}
\label{sec:The_Lead_Time_Syndrome}

In this section we present a formalisation of the \LTS{}.
%
\MS[t]{TODO} The section is split into two
parts. First we will present the method for single-stage manufacturers, before considering more
stages.
%
It is straightforward to implement the presented methods to establish a \LTS{} detection system, see
Section~\ref{sec:Experimental_Evidence}. We follow the notation established
by~\cite{selccuk2013adaptive} to ease readability.

\subsection{Single-Stage Manufacturing System}
\label{subsec:Single-Stage_Manufacturing_System}


Consider a single product one-stage flow-shop manufacturing system that releases orders from the
order pool into the production system by an external mechanism.
%
Usually the orders are released based on the observed (average) flow time of the last finished
orders. However, our method does not presuppose such an interdependence for detecting the lead time
syndrome as it works directly on (parts of) the \WIP{}-level of the system. Thus our approach is
also able to observe systematic releasing misbehavior, referred to as \LTS{}, which do not consider
the lead time as depended variable for the release decisions.
%
% Intuitively the method works as
% follows. By measuring the change of the average \WIP{}-level over time and comparing this to the
% average releases into the system it can infer the desired property.
%
We denote the demand rate at time $t \geqslant 0$ as $\dr{t}$ \MS[t]{rates needed?}, and the demand
for the item during the period defined by timestamps $t_{2} \geqslant t_{1} \geqslant 0$ as
$\di{t_{1}}{t_{2}}$. Similarly we denote the order release rate as $\rr{t}$ and the releases within
a period as $\ri{t_{1}}{t_{2}}$. Each work-station $i$ is equipped with a queue $\q_{i}$ on which
released orders are appended according to a given routing and from there handed over to the
work-station if only if the work-station is empty and the order is at the head of the queue. Thus we
allow parallel processing of unique orders with non-shared queues in the setup. In case of shared
queues in this single item setup the work-station shall be considered as a single work-station. The
size of a queue $\size{\q_{i}} \geqslant 0$ is given by the number of orders within the queue.


\begin{definition}

  The \emph{queue size} $\size{\Q_{i}}$ of stage $i$ is defined as
  $\size{\Q_{i}} \defsym \sum_{i=1}^{n} \size{\q_{i}}$, where $n$ is the number of work-stations of stage
  $i$. Note that in this subsection we set $i=1$.

\end{definition}


As the demand may vary over time, e.g.~in a seasonal pattern or simply by some variance, it must be
considered as time factor in the formulation of the lead time syndrome. To clarify, consider a
seasonal demand. It can clearly not be considered a lead time syndrome if the releases just depict
the demand.

\MS{maybe use continuous representation below?}

\begin{definition}
  The \emph{periodised demand} $\dper{p}$ for any period $p \in \Nat$ is given by
  $\dper{p} = \max(0,\dmean(\frac{p+p+1}{2}) + \epsilon) = \di{p}{p+1}$, where $\dmean$ is a
  function which maps any given period to the expected mean demand at this period and $\epsilon$ is
  drawn from a random variable $\X$ with mean $0$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. Note that $f$
  must not necessarily be continuous.
  % Note that the periodised demand is only defined over natural numbers, which describe the current
  % period.
\end{definition}


\begin{example}
  In case of a constant demand, $\dmean$ maps to a constant value and $\epsilon = 0$, whereas for a
  seasonal demand $f$ in a continuous space one may use the sine-function and
  $\X \sim \N{0}{\sigma^{2}}$.
  %
  \MS[t]{maybe refer to inventory control, as there $\N{0}{\cdot}$ is also used?}

  % In most cases we expect the random variable to be drawn from the
  % standard distribution $\X \sim \N{0}{\sigma^{2}}$ and in case of a discrete demand space applying
  % the nearest integer function.
\end{example}

In practise the available demand data is used to infer the function $\dmean$ and the value for
$\sigma$. This could be done using regression and statistical analyses. Therefore, in hereafter
these values are expected to be known.

% \MS{needed at all? we got the variance. But the max operator is used?}
% \begin{definition}
%   We define the \emph{mean deviation demand} $\ddev{t}$ with time $t \geqslant 0$ as
%   $\ddev{t} \defsym \di{t}{t+1} - \dmean(\frac{2t+1}{2})$. That is we subtract the mean from the
%   demand to be able to investigate the deviations solely.
%   % \begin{align*}
%   %   \ddev{t} \defsym
%   %   \begin{cases}
%   %     1 + \epsilon & \text{iff }\dmean(\frac{2t+1}{2}) = 0\\
%   %     \dmean^{-1}(\frac{2t+1}{2}) \cdot \dmean(\frac{2t+1}{2}) + \epsilon & \text{otherwise}
%   %   \end{cases}
%   %   \tpkt
%   % \end{align*}
%   % Note that $\dmean(\cdot)$ is a scalar value and thus the inverse $\dmean^{-1}(\cdot)$ exists
%   % unless the mean demand is $0$.
% \end{definition}
% The standardised demand allows us to extract useful information from the deviations of the

The higher the standard deviation of the demand, the more likely it is to find high fluctuations in
the release pattern. Thus, the scaled deviations in the demand specify a natural lower-bound of
release decisions to consider in the analysis of the \LTS{}.
%
Hence, we use the standard deviation $\sigma$ of the random variable $\X$ in relation to the mean
demand as measure for determining the time span being considered. Recall that the standard deviation
measures the expected deviation of the mean in orders.
%
%
% Thus, $2 \sigma$ specify the (minimum) expected deviation of the demand and thus also the release
% decisions from one period to the next.
%
Futhermore,... \MS[t]{seasonal stuff}
%


\begin{definition}
  We define the \emph{time span} $\ts(p)$ in period $p$ of the manufacturing system
  % with the periodised demand $\dper{\cdot}$
  under investigation as
  \begin{align*}
    \ts(p) \defsym 1 + \frac{ \zs \cdot 2 \sigma}{\frac{1}{p} \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{p}{f(i)}} +
    \MS[t]{\text{seasonal stuff todo}} \tcom
  \end{align*}
  where $\zs$ is a scaling parameter for specifying the confidence interval being considered. This
  definition assumes a symmetric probability distribution of $\X$ in the second term. For asymmetric
  probability distributions, the definition can be easily extended to integrate
\end{definition}


The reduce the impact of outliers we average the actual releases over $k$ values.
